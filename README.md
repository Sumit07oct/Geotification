#Geofence detection app:

This app basically detects if user has entered/exit in any geofence location. Below are steps to test the app :

1. Add geofence location by clicking on plus icon on top right of landing page.

2. choose location on map on Add  Geotification screen and pin to choosen location.

3. select if you want to add geofence notification upon exit or upon entry.

4. enter radius for region and give message for notification.

5. click on add button on top right button to add this geofence location.

6. This will be shown on landing page along with radius region of geofence.

7. Now once user will enter in this location, app will notify user based on added geofence notification (exit or entry or both).

8. I was using app with simulator so I used some custom location and added them as gpx file for testing purpose.
